# MLP VS CNN FOR Multi-digit dataset

`Feature Extraction:`

    1. MLP: MLPs do not consider spatial relationships in the data. They treat input data as a flattened vector. This might not be suitable for images, where spatial features are crucial.

    2. CNN: CNNs are specifically designed for image data. They use convolutional layers to automatically extract relevant features from images, preserving spatial relationships.

`Performance:`

    1. MLP: In general, MLPs may not perform as well as CNNs on image classification tasks. This is because they do not capture spatial hierarchies in data, which is essential for recognizing patterns in images.
    2. CNN: CNNs excel at image-related tasks, thanks to their ability to capture hierarchical features and patterns. They tend to achieve higher accuracy on image datasets.

`Model Complexity:`

    1. MLP: MLPs can have a large number of parameters, which can make them more prone to overfitting, especially if the dataset is limited.
    2. CNN: CNNs have fewer parameters and share weights through convolutional layers, which helps reduce overfitting and allows them to be trained effectively on smaller datasets.

`Training Time:`

    1. MLP: Training MLPs can be faster compared to CNNs since there are fewer parameters to optimize.
    2. CNN: CNNs may require more time to train due to the convolutional layers' operations, but this is often offset by better performance.

`Model Choice:`

    1. MLP: MLPs are better suited for tasks where spatial relationships in the data are not essential, such as tabular data, text classification, or simple non-image data.
    2. CNN: CNNs are a natural choice for image-related tasks and should be preferred for tasks involving visual data.


For the Multi-Digit MNIST dataset, which involves images, using a CNN is generally the more appropriate choice due to its ability to capture spatial features, which are essential for recognizing and classifying multiple digits in an image. A CNN is likely to provide higher accuracy and better performance on this specific task compared to an MLP.

In summary, while both MLPs and CNNs can be used for image-related tasks, the choice should be based on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the task. For image datasets like Multi-Digit MNIST, CNNs are the standard choice due to their ability to extract relevant features and spatial relationships, resulting in improved accuracy and performance.

## MLP VS CNN FOR Permuted-MNIST dataset

### 1. Contrast the performances of MLP vs. CNN for both datasets:

`MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron):`

    1. An MLP performed well on the Permuted-MNIST dataset, achieving decent accuracy.
    It has a relatively simple architecture with fully connected layers and is designed for structured data.
    It doesn't take advantage of the spatial structure in the images, which is a challenge in the Permuted-MNIST dataset.
    CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):

`A CNN outperformed the MLP on the Permuted-MNIST dataset.`

    2. CNNs are designed to capture spatial features in images, making them more suitable for image classification tasks.
    The convolutional layers can automatically extract relevant features from the input data, which is essential for recognizing digits in different permutations.

### 2. Observations and challenges:

    1. Challenges: The MLP struggled to perform well on the Permuted-MNIST dataset because it doesn't consider the spatial structure of the images. The random permutations make it harder for the MLP to recognize the digits effectively.
    Overfitting: The MLP may be prone to overfitting due to its large number of parameters and limited ability to capture spatial information.
    CNN:

    2. Observations: The CNN performed better than the MLP on the Permuted-MNIST dataset because it can automatically learn and capture spatial features.
    Challenges: Designing a suitable CNN architecture and hyperparameter tuning can be challenging. Convolutional neural networks have more parameters and require more training data to perform well.


### 3. Compare the potential for overfitting between a CNN and an MLP in the context of datasets:

`MLP`:

    High Potential for Overfitting: MLPs can have a high potential for overfitting, especially when the dataset is small, and the network has many parameters.
    Less Spatial Understanding: Since MLPs don't consider spatial relationships in data, they may require a larger number of parameters to fit complex patterns, increasing the risk of overfitting.

`CNN`:

    Moderate Potential for Overfitting: CNNs typically have a moderate potential for overfitting. They are designed to automatically capture spatial features in data.
    Spatial Understanding: CNNs have built-in spatial understanding due to convolutional and pooling layers, which helps in reducing overfitting. However, deeper architectures may still be prone to overfitting if not enough data is available.

In summary, both MLPs and CNNs can overfit, but the potential for overfitting may be higher in MLPs due to their lack of spatial understanding. CNNs tend to generalize better on tasks like image classification, but the risk of overfitting still exists, especially when using very deep architectures with limited data. Proper regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, are important in mitigating overfitting in both cases.
